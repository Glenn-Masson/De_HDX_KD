###De_hDx_kD (or 3D scripts)

This repository contains two python scripts which allow for the determination of Kd_app values from HDX-MS data. 

The first script HDX KD data analysis HDXaminer.py takes a HDXaminer (Sierra Analytics/Trajan) export file and can derive Kd_app values from shifts in solvent exchange. Further informaiton can be found in its dedicated readme.txt document. 

The second script take ECD (or in reality, any HDX-MS/MS c/z fragments) and derives single amino acid resolution Kd_app values. It currently uses an exported data file format not widely available, but once this becomes available we will update this Github to ensure ease of use for other users. It also has a dedicated readme.txt document. 

Happy Kd'ing.
